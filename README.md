# README ‚Äì Artisan Spectroscopy and Plasma Analysis (Low-tech + AI)

## üî¨ Scientific Interest

Spectroscopy is a cornerstone tool in both physics and astronomy. It enables the decomposition of light emitted or absorbed by a source to analyze its chemical composition, physical state, or temperature. In this project, spectroscopy is applied to various light sources, ranging from the Sun to a synthetic plasmoid, with a hands-on, frugal, and AI-assisted methodology.

Notably, **plasma** represents **over 99% of the observable matter in the universe**, including stars, nebulae, and interstellar clouds. On Earth, plasma appears naturally in phenomena such as **auroras** and **lightning**. Understanding plasma spectra therefore bridges terrestrial and astrophysical physics.

## üß∞ Spectroscope Construction

A spectroscope was assembled using salvaged components:

- Lenses from an old binocular set
- Pl√∂ssl-type telescope eyepiece
- Adjustable slit made from two razor blades
- 100 lines/mm diffraction grating
- Materials: PVC tubing, wood, screws

Observations were recorded through:

- Direct visual inspection
- Digiscopy (digital camera aligned with eyepiece)
- Webcam with an adapter

## üí° Observed Sources

1. **Mercury discharge tube** (‚Äúneon‚Äù tube)
2. **Compact fluorescent lamp** (Hg vapor variant)
3. **High-pressure sodium streetlamp (Na + Hg)**
4. **Homemade plasmoid in glass globe**
5. **Sunlight diffused through magnesium carbonate pellet (MgCO‚ÇÉ)**

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Carbon Plasmoid (Microwave-based)

A graphite rod was inserted into a glass globe and exposed inside a kitchen microwave. The electromagnetic field heated the rod, causing carbon vaporization and the formation of a luminous, unstable plasma ‚Äî resembling a confined ball lightning.

This experiment visually recreates what is hypothesized in plasma physics as auto-sustained confined discharges, akin to phenomena still not fully explained in the lab.

## ü§ñ Spectral Analysis with LLM

The plasmoid‚Äôs spectrum was analyzed using a large language model (GPT-4 / Grok):

- **Thermal continuum in orange** (\~590‚Äì610 nm), consistent with blackbody emission at 2500‚Äì3000 K
- **C‚ÇÇ Swan bands** in the green (510‚Äì560 nm)
- Likely **CN violet bands** (385‚Äì420 nm), though partially attenuated due to camera sensor limitations

A Bayesian inference based on known reference spectra yielded a >93% probability of molecular band presence.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Observation (Fraunhofer lines)

With safe indirect solar observation, the following absorption lines were visually identified:

- **HŒ± (656 nm)**
- **Na doublet (589.0 & 589.6 nm)**
- **Mg triplet (\~517 nm)**
- **Fe absorption lines (\~527‚Äì540 nm)**
- **HŒ≤ (486 nm)**

‚ö†Ô∏è Never observe the Sun directly without proper safety filters. Here, a **MgCO‚ÇÉ pellet** was used to safely diffuse sunlight.

## üìä Software Workflow

- Outdated spectrometry software being non-functional, the entire analysis pipeline was rebuilt using:
  - **ImageJ**: spectral profile extraction
  - **Excel**: wavelength calibration (using known peaks) and charting
